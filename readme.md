# My Plant Recognition

 In this project, the Jetson Nano will use the imagenet network and utilize transfer learning to be able to identify different species of plants. Being able to successfully identify the type of plant in an individualâ€™s possession would allow them to conduct research and find the ideal conditions for that plant to thrive if they wanted it to grow in their garden. Another purpose of this detection is to identify if these plants are harmful in any way. This could include harmful to other plants in the area as well as harmful to humans.
 
## The Algorithm

In order for the nano to  detect what species of plant there is, it has to transfer learn. In order to start this process the nano has to be trained in order to detect these plants. Once it goes through the training stage, the nano goes through the validation stage. In this stage, the nano will test it's accuracy in identifying each type of plant. One of these cycles is called an epoch. Thre more epochs the greater the accuracy.
