# My Plant Recognition

 In this project, the Jetson Nano will use the imagenet network and utilize transfer learning to be able to identify healthy types of plants. Being able to successfully identify a healthy plant in an individualâ€™s possession saves them time from having to care for a sick or dying plant. Furthermore, an individual to continue to grow their plants.  Another purpose of this detection is to identify if these plants are harmful in any way.
 
## The Algorithm

In order for the nano to detect healthy plants, it has to transfer learn. In order to start this process the nano has to be trained in order to detect these plants. Once it goes through the training stage, the nano goes through the validation stage. In this stage, the nano will test its accuracy in identifying each type of plant. One of these cycles is called an epoch. Thre more epochs the greater the accuracy. There is also one more stage called the test stage. This is not required for training the nano but is made for the user to test out the accuracy of the detection.
